# Define a class called Car.

# Define three class variables - "model" (string), "year" (integer), 
# and "color" (string).

# Define a class constructor that takes three values as input parameters
# and assigns them to the class' member variables.

# Define a class method called "start" that prints "starting car" to the console.

# Define a getter and setter for the "year" property.  The setter should
# reject any values that are less than 1886.
